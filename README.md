## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

In this project, we will be automating the login and registration modules of a sample application using Appium and Robot Framework. The sample application may be any mobile application that requires user authentication to access its features.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.
- First things first, you should install the Python first, you can download [here](https://www.python.org/)

- Next, install the Appium, you can download [here](https://appium.io/)

- Then, install the library what we need to run the project. You can use command:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    robot --version
    ```
    Or if you want to running using `.venv`, you can follow this steps:
    ```
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    robot --version
    ```

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

To running the test, please follow this steps:
- Turn on your Android Emulator or you can use real device

- Turn on your Appium Desktop or Appium Server or you can using Appium in terminal:
